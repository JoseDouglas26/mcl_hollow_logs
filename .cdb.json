    "long_description": "# mcl_hollow_logs\n## Description\nAdds hollow logs to each Mineclonia tree/hypha. Equivalent to [vl_hollow_logs](https://git.minetest.land/VoxeLibre/VoxeLibre/src/branch/master/mods/ITEMS/vl_hollow_logs) in Voxelibre. These logs can be crafted from their normal variants, whether stripped or not. Like normal logs, hollow logs can be oriented on all three axes. Also like overworld logs, overworld hollow logs can be used as fuel and can also be used to make charcoal when burned in a furnace. Unstripped hollow logs can be stripped using axes.\n### Crafting\n[ \\[&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \\] \\[Log\\] \\[&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \\] ] <br>\n[ \\[Log\\] \\[&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \\] \\[Log\\] ] [Hollow log 4] <br>\n[ \\[&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \\] \\[Log\\] \\[&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \\] ] <br>\n## License\n### License of source code:\n\nMIT License:\n\nCopyright (c) 2024 JoseDouglas26\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
